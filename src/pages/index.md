  > "I love making a difference in people's lives and to be part of their
  decision making when they start a new chapter in life. Through my experience
  in design and construction, I discovered my real passion -- working with
  people's property and design needs. I can sell your home or discover your next
  dream home. I value the best customer service and will take the time to
  understand and act on your preferences. For example, those with changes in
  lifestyle such as remote work or frequent traveling might mean prioritizing
  amenities over location. I will work with you to understand your top needs and
  find them for you. My clients consistently note my attentiveness and
  flexibility.

  >

  > I can also show you great value rentals and well-located commercial
  properties. I've found many rentals for my clients and am always considerate
  of busy schedules and specific needs such as parking and storage space, or
  public transportation. I've found great locations for commercial properties
  and designed more retails stores than I can count!

  >

  > Finally, I can even help you stage your home, fix design problems in your
  home or design your dream kitchen! If you feel as though your home "isn't
  working for your needs", sometimes all it takes is a better layout and design.
  I can make your home work for you while increasing the value of your home. If
  it truly won't fit your needs, I will find someone who will love your home.”

        Yoshie was so great to work with! My boyfriend and I were looking to
        move into our first apartment together in Hoboken and she helped us each
        step of the way, and found us an amazing apartment. She was able to work
        around our busy work schedules and really took into account what kind of
        place we were looking for. When it came time to submitting the
        application and moving in, she took the time out to check in with us and
        make sure all was going well. Overall we had a great and positive
        experience with Yoshie.

        Yoshie was very personable in her service delivery. Obviously she helped
        us sell our house, but that was not only service she provided.  She went
        extra miles to decorate our charming house to attract the wider range of
        audiences using her great interior design skills. She also assisted us
        find all   necessary service providers for any miscellaneous repairs.
        Some of them were time sensitive for the closing, and Yoshie pushed all
        service providers to complete their jobs in time.  We could depend on
        her on any aspects of tasks from inception to compl. I recommend Yoshie
        to all people in needs of “personal” real estate services.
