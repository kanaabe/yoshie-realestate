        Yoshie was so great to work with! My boyfriend and I were looking to
        move into our first apartment together in Hoboken and she helped us each
        step of the way, and found us an amazing apartment. She was able to work
        around our busy work schedules and really took into account what kind of
        place we were looking for. When it came time to submitting the
        application and moving in, she took the time out to check in with us and
        make sure all was going well. Overall we had a great and positive
        experience with Yoshie.
