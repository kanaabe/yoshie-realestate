Hello! Thanks for reading my blog. My name is Yoshie Abe and I am a realtor for Group 26 Realtors. 

Prior to Real Estate, I was an interior designer and project manager for retail stores such as Tumi, Tommy Hilfiger, and Footlocker. I discovered my passion for real estate as I was working with interior design. I noticed how happy my clients were in the retail space, and I wanted to bring that same happiness to home owners. With an eye for design, I am committed to finding your future home or selling your current one.
